    "map_description": "The Von Neumann Mark III is the latest modernized edition of a previously mothballed frigate, mounting fairly advanced technology in a small and robust hull. Initially, these ships are used for clearing very dense asteroid fields and space junk with their disproportionately large point defense armament, however because of this relatively mundane and civilian task, these ships mount next to no armor, and have a higher crew requirement than even some larger ships. when pressed into combat service, all the same, they can be extremely threatening thanks to their still extant VLS system, and the sheer volume of point defense weapons. as with all solgov ships, they feature shields as their first line of defense",
