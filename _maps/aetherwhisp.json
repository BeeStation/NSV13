    "map_description": "The Aetherwhisp was originally designed by an independent contractor signed with The Solar Confederate government. Now in full mass production, this ship design serves as deep space exploration vessels, scout ships for the SolGov fleet, and is occasionally leased to WhiteRapids for use as a QRF. The ships are outfitted with plenty of amenities and creature comforts to simulate a “home away from home” for longerform missions.",
