	"map_description": "The Shrike was once in service some time ago but has recently been unearthed as a schematic for cheap, fast ships perfect for use as a QRF. Most if not all Shrike-Class ships have been abandoned for some time in one shipyard or another until Whiterapids bought them en masse and outfitted them to the bare minimum requirements. As a result, Shrike vessels lack some amenities and technologies, though they leave plenty of room for crew improvements.",
