	"map_description": "Shrike-class vessels were initially commissioned last century and served as light strike frigates before being retired to deep space shipyards in favour of more durable designs. Due to escalating conflict with the Syndicate, WhiteRapids looked to retrofitting decommissioned Shrike-class vessels as cheap alternative to production of brand-new warships. As a result, several more modern technologies are incompatible with the ageing hulls.",
