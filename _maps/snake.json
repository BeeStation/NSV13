A long strip of hallway with compartments well organized and aligned along this hallway leaves the ship relatively easy to navigate and repair in drydock. All of the ship’s maintenance is located on the upper deck with crew operations on the bottom. A medium-weight gunboat whose versatility leaves it universally accepted, and often used as QRF.",
