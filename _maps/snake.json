A long strip of hallway with compartments well organized and aligned along this hallway leaves the ship relatively easy to navigate and repair in drydock. All of the shipâ€™s maintenance is located on the upper deck with crew operations on the bottom. A medium-weight gunboat whose versatility leaves it universally accepted, and often used as QRF.",
