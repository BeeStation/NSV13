    "map_description": "The second ship to bear the name Galactica, an homage to the great dreadnaughts before it. Its schematics are about three times smaller than the ship's actual size to keep prying eyes away. It boasts the strongest weapon in the WhiteRapids arsenal: The Bluespace Artillery Cannon. On top of having incredible amounts of armor, hull, and sheer mass, it features two AGCNRs and a robust crew whenever enough are on shift to run it.",
