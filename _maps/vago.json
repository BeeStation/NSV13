    "map_description": "The basic hull design for Vago ships are no longer being manufactured and instead the existing ships are being maintained to the best of DDM’s capabilities. Vago vessels are often stripped for parts when repairing other ships which leaves what few Vago ships still in service in a sorry state. Pray you never serve upon a Vago vessel as they are only sent on QRF as a punishment for the crew or for the Brass’ sick laughs.",
