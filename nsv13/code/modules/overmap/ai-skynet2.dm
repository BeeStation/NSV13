/*SKYNET 2 AI by Kmc2000

"Because SKYNET 1 wasn't good enough."

This implements fleet movement for AIs through the use of very basic "utility score" AI programming.

How this works:

Instead of a traditional decision tree like we used back in SKYNET 1, Skynet 2 uses utility scoring, a technique similar to GOAP.

Instead of giving the AI a preset, flat list of decisions to make, the AI will now make decisions "on the fly" based on what task is most important to it at the time.
-This can vary! And can be anything you want. Maybe you're making a asteroid slinger ship, and you want to ensure that it has an asteroid to fling at someone BEFORE attacking an enemy ship. In this case, you'd just say that the "get asteroid" goal is more important to the AI than the "search and destroy" goal. (Though be sure to lock it to that specific ship via traits!)

This code uses singleton datums to give AI orders.
Workflow:
AIs like score, every few seconds, they'll run through all the subtypes of datum/ai_goal, which are stored in a global list. If it has a goal, and finds a higher priority task, it'll switch focus to whatever task we want it to.
Example:

Frame 1: Ai shoots ship, runs out of ammo
Frame 2: Ai ship's "search and destroy" goal is now a lower priority than its resupply goal, as it recognises that it's fresh out of ammo. It'll now go find a supply ship and get re-armed there.

Current task hierarchy (as of 28/06/2020)!

1: Repair and re-arm. If a ship becomes critically damaged, or runs out of bullets, it will rush to a supply ship to resupply (if available), and heal up.
2: (if you're a battleship): Defend the supply lines. Battleships stick close to the supply ships and keep them safe.
3: Search and destroy: Attempt to find a target that's visible and within tracking range.
4: (All ships) Defend the supply lines: If AIs cannot find a suitable target, they'll flock back to the main fleet and protect the tankers. More nimble attack squadrons will blade off in wings and attack the enemy if they get too close, with the battleships staying behind to protect their charges.

Adding tasks is easy! Just define a datum for it.
