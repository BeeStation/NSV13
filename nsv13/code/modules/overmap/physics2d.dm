#define MAXIMUM_COLLISION_RANGE 12 //In tiles, what is the range of the maximum possible collision that could take place? Please try and keep this low, as it saves a lot of time and memory because it'll just ignore physics bodies that are too far away from each other.
//That being said. If you want to make a ship that is bigger than this in tile size, then you will have to change this number. As of 11/08/2020 the LARGEST possible collision range is 25 tiles, due to the fist of sol existing. Though tbh if you make a sprite much larger than this, byond will likely just cull it from the viewport.
