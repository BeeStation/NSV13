	SAY Project Zelbinion is a defensive screen reactor. It works by projecting hardened particles around the ship.
	DELAY 50
	SAY The reactor runs off of Nucleium, a byproduct of plasma enriched nuclear fission.
	DELAY 50
	SAY Once activated, the reactor must be run constantly until termination. The particle stream cannot be interrupted, or you risk an emission.
	DELAY 50
	SAY Project Zelbinion is equipped with automated shutdown measures which should prevent causality failure, however your ship will NOT be unscathed.
	DELAY 50
	SAY The reactor runs off of two consoles. Use them in tandem to control the reaction.
	DELAY 50
	SAY The first stat you have control over is input power. Ensure you do not exceed the stated maximum power, or be below the minimum. This will lead to emission.
	DELAY 50
	SAY As you raise your input power, you also raise the ability for the PDSR to project particles around the ship, leading to a stronger particle screen.
	DELAY 50
	SAY The next reaction variable you can control is Nucleium injection rate. A higher rate, like power, leads to a more powerful shield.
	DELAY 50
	SAY Nucleium injection can be spiked for a quick combat boost, but be warned that this will destabilise the reactor.
	DELAY 50
	SAY The shield variables themselves can be controlled separately. Use them to your advantage.
	DELAY 50
	SAY The reactor's stability is affected by the reaction polarity. Flip the injection polarity from negative to positive as needed to keep the polarity as close to 0 as possible.
	DELAY 50
	SAY If you need to shut down the reactor, lower the nucleium injection rate slowly. You can cycle coolant in an emergency for a quick cooling boost.
	DELAY 50
	SAY The reaction can be terminated when the reactor core is under 100 Celsius. Ensure cooling is adequate to achieve this.
	DELAY 50
	SAY Finally. If your minimum input power ever starts to converge on the maximum, you are heading towards an emission. Rectify this immediately, or shut down the reactor safely.
