SYSADMIN - Allcrew@seegnet.nt. RE: Emergency Meltdown proceedures. The nuclear storm drive is an inherently safe engine, however this does not mean it is foolproof. Dilligence will mean the difference between having a safe, reliable power output which can last for decades, and a nuclear hellfire which can destroy the entire ship. A reactor will melt down when the fission inside it produces an uncontrollable amount of heat (in excess of 300 degrees celsius). If this ever happens, a shipwide alarm will sound. If you hear this alarm, you must act quickly and calmly, as you will have approximately 1 to 2 minutes before the reactor explodes. Simply locate the control console, and choose the "SCRAM" setting (the button labelled AZ-5). This will immediately lower all control rods and attempt to cool the reactor. In the event of damaged control rods, IMMEDIATELY shut off all plasma constrictors, supply pumps and filters and evacuate the engineering section IMMEDIATELY to prevent unecessary loss of life. In the event of a meltdown, nuclear fuel is deposited all over the ship, and must be cleaned up with a shovel. This spent fuel is HIGHLY radioactive, and must be handled with extreme care. If the unthinkable comes to pass, instruct crew to seek shelter in maintenance and proceed to immediately evacuate the ship. To avoid complications, it is recommended that engineers equip radiation-proof suits and gas masks, and proceed to clear a path to the evacuation arm with shovels. Remember: Stay safe through vigilance!
