In order to permit firing by the weapons operator, weapons must be loaded with the following proceedure: 1: Load desired munition into firing tray, 2: Load firing tray into chamber, 3: Chamber the round, 4: Disengage safeties. To avoid weapon jams, ensure the system is well-oiled and follow standard maintenance proceedures. Torpedo construction procedures are classified to standard crew.
