changes:
  - code_imp: Ship interior loading now uses a queue system (for virtual z using things
      like Sabres & Asteroids)
  - code_imp: Some overmap z generation handling is ever so slightly cleaner now.
  - bugfix: Should resolve certain atom init issues (that manifested as broken sparks,
      among many other things).
