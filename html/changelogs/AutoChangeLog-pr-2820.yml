changes:
  - rscadd: 'READ THIS: New / adjusted keys: TAC: "F" can filter missile weapon ammo
      when active; Pilot can also switch between active weapons; 1-4 keys can select
      weapons for either operator.'
  - refactor: Refactored everything about ship weapon datums. Elaborating would fill
      this changelog, check the PR.
  - rscadd: Weapon order sorting can now be adjusted via TAC consoles.
  - tweak: Ghost ships now use the real TAC UI.
  - tweak: The aiming laser should now be more centered.
  - tweak: Aiming beam trajectory should behave the same as the actual projectiles
      fired.
  - tweak: ghost ship pilots can restart piloting if they somehow clicked the end
      piloting button.
  - code_imp: AI ship maximum ammo is no longer implied by their initial ammo, instead
      being a seperate var.
  - bugfix: Fighter air-to-air repair works on big ships now like it says it does
      (albeit much slower).
  - bugfix: Broadside guns no longer runtime if you crowbar them.
  - bugfix: The broadside gun machinery firing call is no longer malformed.
  - bugfix: Probe torp projectiles once again have an icon.
  - bugfix: Overmap pixel projectile firing should now be less janky.
  - bugfix: Hybrid Railguns no longer runtime on fire due to a malform firing argument.
  - bugfix: Unloading already empty weapons no longer runtimes.
  - bugfix: The plasma caster no longer runtimes if created without an adjacent loader
      / its loader being deleted is now accounted for (can be linked via multitool).
  - bugfix: Space mines no longer runtime when affecting an area-less ship.
  - bugfix: The TAC console no longer yanks you back into control under some circumstances.
  - bugfix: Some interior-exterior Fighter access attempts weren't caught before.
  - bugfix: A lot of overmap related angle stuff should be less jank now.
  - bugfix: Ghost ships are now semi-properly added to their systems.
  - bugfix: Holomaps don't runtime on component destroy sometimes.
  - bugfix: Prison grilles no longer runtime when exploded.
  - bugfix: Throwmode doesn't runtime when keybind is used on weird hudded mobs (e.g.
      ghost ship pilots).
  - bugfix: The MPAC projectile now behaves somewhat saner.
  - bugfix: The overmap clickdrag procs no longer brick horribly if you mouse over
      chat.
  - bugfix: 'The overmap gunning component no longer does expensive clickdrag reactions
      if not automatic (reads: for nothing).'
  - bugfix: Fighters should no longer runtime during destruction if their canopy was
      not broken beforehand
  - bugfix: You cannot control space rocks.
  - bugfix: The MPAC projectile no longer multihits targets on each tile move (it
      can still multihit them on seperate tile moves as is intended).
  - balance: Turf piercing projectiles aren't always destroyed when intercepting missiles.
  - balance: The MPAC projectile is much more resilient to guided warheads.
  - balance: The MPAC projectile no longer relays to overmaps.
