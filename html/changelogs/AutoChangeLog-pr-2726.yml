changes:
  - bugfix: Foam no longer persists infinitely when combined with hulljuice / firefoam
      (diminishing returns)
  - balance: Cooking Oil contact damage is now lower / more reasonable (I consider
      that one a bug for reasons I am not going into detail on)
  - bugfix: Love potions do not work on knpcs. (They feel no love)
  - bugfix: Several repair sources that bypassed the point of no return no longer
      do so.
  - bugfix: Several AI-related overmap checks should now be more sane (especially
      not being weird if not on an overmap).
  - bugfix: AIs no longer die if the exosuit that is being remote controlled is destroyed.
      They flash-sever the connection instead. (Assuming core exists and you used
      a beacon, not the malf override)
  - balance: To balance out AIs no longer immediately dying if they do not disconnect
      from a mech early, they now take 33% of maximum integrity in feedback damage
      if forcibly disconnected from a mech (via destruction). This should preserve
      at least some involvement in making the decision to disconnect.
  - bugfix: AI camera networks should behave a LOT better while remote controlling
      mechs, ESPECIALLY when taking them to other z levels, fixing a plethora of related
      bugs (mostly related to static, equipment usage, and so on).
  - bugfix: You can no longer set ships to autopilot which never were AI controlled
      in the first place.
  - bugfix: Sabres & Fighters can't buy things from stations anymore (Do it from a
      big ship instead)
  - bugfix: You cannot make Sabres / Fighters within another small craft. Use your
      time more wisely.
  - bugfix: The astrometrics sensors no longer pierce bluespace into other sectors
      (You'll have to be there to scan those)
  - bugfix: Pool ladders can no longer be built infinitely because somebody forgot
      their doafter mistrust.
  - code_imp: Reworked a bunch of NAC code, especially around linkages, bad typing,
      unsafe stuff.. and so on.
  - bugfix: NAC cores no longer preserve linkage when unanchored.
  - bugfix: NAC machines no longer preserve linkage when unanchored (at least most
      of them).
  - bugfix: NAC machines can no longer be single-tile stacked (and work) (at least
      most of them).
  - bugfix: NAC machines can no longer be multilinked to several NACs (at least most
      of them).
  - bugfix: NAC machines should now behave better when being destroyed (code-wise).
  - tweak: NAC cores now tell you what is wrong during linkage.
  - tweak: A bunch of maps had their munitions cores changed due to the retyping of
      them I did because their type was very very bad.
  - code_imp: take_quadrant_damage doesn't discard damage anymore if the ship has
      no quadrants (and just goes directly to take_damage)
