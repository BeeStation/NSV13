changes:
  - tweak: Relayed projectiles now have a higher degree of targeting randomness.
  - tweak: Relayed projectile starting sides are now determined by the angle of the
      original projectile.
  - tweak: Projectile impact quadrants are now determined by projectile facing rather
      than relative position to ship (hopefully feels more accurate).
