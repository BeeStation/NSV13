changes:
  - rscadd: Munitions pinpointers, specialized to track critical munitions items (mostly
      circuits)
  - code_imp: Destroy preservation got moved from ALL /parts of munitions to ONLY
      firing electronics (for that subset of types), as a lot of /parts are meant
      to be destroyed, a lot.
