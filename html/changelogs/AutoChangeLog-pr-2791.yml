changes:
  - rscadd: Escape pods now show up on the minimap during relevant times (aka when
      the escape shuttle is doing something).
  - imageadd: Escape pod minimap marker.
  - tweak: Escape pods are now valid areas for the holomap.
  - bugfix: Holomaps now init later to allow them to render shuttles (when said shuttle
      area is allowed).
  - bugfix: Hangar areas are now displayed in the correct color when on the holomap.
  - code_imp: Shifted around a bit of code in the holomap subsystem which should have
      no additional effect.
  - bugfix: Engineering areas should now more consistently be colored in engineering's
      color on the holomap.
