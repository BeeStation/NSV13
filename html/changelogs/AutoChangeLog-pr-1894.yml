changes:
  - bugfix: fixed Bee's radial menu Z movement having some weird type requirements
      on the starting turf
  - tweak: made Move-Upwards and Move-Down use the animated travel_z proc for living
      things
  - bugfix: fixed sentient disease Z movement
  - bugfix: allowed most jaunt movement types to travel multi-Z regardless of gravity
      (includes revenants but not ninjas)
  - tweak: added a passthrough for attack_hand on stairs so the radial menu for multi-z
      travel would show up
