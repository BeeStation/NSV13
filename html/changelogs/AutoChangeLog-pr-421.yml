changes: 
  - rscadd: "Changed the way ship combat works overall by adding flak, gauss guns (which need people to man them) and reworked PDCs to just be for close quarters defense, rather than a perfect screen against missiles"
  - rscadd: "Added FTL console and Tactical console have received a UI change to make them less horrible"
  - tweak: "Tweaked the way in which projectiles use their IFFs. Should be more efficient now."
