changes:
  - rscadd: Small craft can now be docked by valid craft initiating collision with
      them, as opposed to it having to be the other way around, provided docking mode
      is enabled. Doing it this way around forcibly enables the small craft's brakes
      if it lacks a working pilot.
  - tweak: Escape pods no longer have an access requirement (to eject occupants via
      ID).
  - bugfix: Fighter escape pods being destroyed no longer messes up the occupant(s)'s
      movement once revived.
  - bugfix: Fighter escape pods no longer drop part of their equipment on creation
      (and as such actually have a canopy).
  - bugfix: Weapon selection dropping no longer drops a single runtime if called by
      a Fighter being destroyed.
  - bugfix: Fighter escape pods being created on a non-overmap z no longer runtimes.
  - imageadd: Overlay for escape pods missing their canopy.
