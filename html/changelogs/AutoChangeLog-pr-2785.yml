changes:
  - bugfix: GQ (red) lights auto-disabling after some time isn't broken anymore.
  - bugfix: Zebra alert doesn't allow non-operational firelocks to operate.
  - tweak: the zebra interlock mapping helper is now deprecated (as it didn't actually
      do anything).
  - rscdel: Window spawners no longer contain a zebra interlock mapping helper.
