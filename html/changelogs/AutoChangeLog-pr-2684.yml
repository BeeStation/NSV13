changes:
  - balance: Lizards are now coldblooded (they have no natural bodytemperature stabilization
      besides the environment).
  - balance: Coldblooded creatures also have an inefficient form of thermogenesis
      they can use to heat up.
  - balance: Lizards dislike the cold (<15°C / when you start shivering) and like
      warmth (30°C-60°C), which can affect mood.
  - balance: Lizards no longer have a 1.5 cold damage modifier.
  - balance: Having somebody in an aggressive grab will share temperature between
      the grabber and grabbed target over time (respecting insulation).
  - balance: Drinking blood as a moth now has a weaker mood buff.
  - balance: Naval coffee now has a weaker mood buff.
  - bugfix: Temperature protection values returned by the getter are no longer very
      very slightly off the value they should be. Thanks decimal precision.
