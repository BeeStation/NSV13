changes:
  - rscadd: Robotic legs can now be modified to a digitigrade version in the augment
      manipulator. Rejoice, full-metal lizards.
  - imageadd: Robot Digitigrade leg sprites.
  - tweak: The CE, Engineering, and Atmos hardsuit once again do not squish digilegs
      (we had the sprites still around)
  - code_imp: Some mild hooking into icon code to bypass our own crimes.
  - bugfix: Coincidentally, IPC limbs no longer commit crimes against icons after
      being thrown in the augment manipulator.
  - tweak: The prosthetic limb quirk now respects digitigrade bodytypes.
