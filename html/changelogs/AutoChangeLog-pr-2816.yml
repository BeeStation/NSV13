changes:
  - balance: Package-wrap wrapped items (parcels) now inherit several traits of the
      original item which complicate transport of the item.
  - rscadd: Parcels can now be cut open with any sharp object.
  - bugfix: NAC shell transport behaves more reasonable again, requiring two hands
      to handle (cannonballs are off limits when gravity is on).
  - bugfix: The autobrewery symtom no longer randomly runtimes.
