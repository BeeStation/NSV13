changes:
  - rscadd: Added workshop area to brig based on the holodeck code, where prisoners
      can make donuts or plushes and scan them to get reduced sentences. Adds secure
      floors and prison grilles to help secure the prison area better. Adds crafting
      method for plushes to support the prison plushes sweatshop.
  - rscadd: Added genpop workshops to Hammerhead and Gladius
  - tweak: Changed the path of the previous prisoner id used for gulag (now id/gulag).
      Updated paths of the current holodeck templates to holodeck/recreational to
      allow for easier subtypes implementation. Removed holographic flag preventing
      the crafting menu from working.
  - tweak: Genpop code and icons moved out of nsv13 folder
