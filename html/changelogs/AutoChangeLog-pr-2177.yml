changes:
  - refactor: Converted all character + preference data to live in the database instead
      of savefiles
  - server: You will need to convert all your old savefiles. Good luck.
  - tweak: Changed preferred squad and preferred pilot role to be linked to the active
      character. Your squad and pilot role have likely been reset to defaults.
  - code_imp: Put the widescreen preference in toggles2 instead of it being standalone
