	<h1>You are a bloodling thrall!</h1>
	<img src="changeling.gif"/>
	<p>You serve the master, and must obey any command given to you by them (even death).</p>
	<p><img src="hivemind.png"/>The master's thralls can communicate over their <b>hivemind channel</b>, access it via your HUD on the top left of your screen.</p>
	<p>The master's servants come in many forms, its ascended humanoid thralls may also receive other objectives. <b>However, these come secondary to your servitude of the master.</b></p>
	<p>The goal of many changelings is to acquire 5-7 DNA strains. To do this, it must take ANY human, living or dead, and acquire their DNA.</p>
	<p><img src="tentacle.png"/>Work together with the other thralls to complete your objectives, but be cautious. The ascended thralls are dangerous as they retain an element of free will... Trust nobody except the master</p>
