	<p>You have been assigned to the SSV Nebuchadnezzar, prototype vessel utilising stolen technology.</p>
	<p>Your objective is to weaken NT's presence in this sector. You can go about this in a few ways.</p>
	<p>The Syndicate gains influence whenever Nanotrasen loses a fleet, and vice versa. <b>Destroy NT fleets</b> to help the Syndicate gain <i>influence</i>.</i></p>

	<p>Your ship is equipped with a lighthouse beacon which can claim systems for the Syndicate and call in reinforcements. Use it wisely! If you send in Syndicate reinforcements, you risk them being destroyed and <b>the Syndicate losing influence because of this</b></p>
