	<h1>You are a Syndicate Crewman!</h1>
	<img src="nukie.png"/>
	<p>You are serving aboard a powerful Syndicate warship.</p>
	<p>Your mission is simple: Board the main Nanotrasen ship and destroy it with a nuclear device.</p>
	<p><img src="nuke.png"/>To detonate your nuke, you must get the nuclear disk from the enemy crew.<img src="disk.png"/></p>
	<p>Your leader is equipped with a nuclear summons device, which can teleport a nuclear warhead to whoever holds it. Use this after you board the enemy to acquire your nuke.</p>
	<p>Boarding the enemy ship is your first priority. Use your Sabre utility vessels to ferry your crew over. For information on how to fly these vessels, refer to <b>https://nsv.beestation13.com/wiki/Guide_to_Fighters</b></p>
	<p>To activate the nuke, you must put in the disk, type in the code, turn off the safety and enable it. You should first unanchor it, move it to the station, re-anchor it and then activate the nuke and take the disk away.</p>
