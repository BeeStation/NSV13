	<p>Gather your strength and build an army, ascend to your final form.</p>
	<p><img src="hivemind.png"/>You and your thralls can communicate over the <b>hivemind channel</b>, access it via your HUD on the top left of your screen.</p>
	<p>You are able to instill life in creatures, making them your obedient slaves. You can <i>infest</i> humans to create ascended thralls, beings of great power. <b>However, be cautious, as they'll retain some free will as a consequence of this.</b></p>
	<p>You start with one thrall already, work together with them over the hivemind channel to build up your strength.</p>
	<p><img src="tentacle.png"/>Use your servants well, and utilise them to meet your goals. When you hit critical biomass, you'll become <b>unstoppable</b>.</p>
