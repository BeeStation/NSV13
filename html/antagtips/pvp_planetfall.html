	<p>The base you are stationed on, Bowie Base 2 underneath the desolate wastes of the planet "Tartarus" in the Scorvio system. This base is an important mental reprogramming facility operated by the Syndicate.</p>
	<p>You must defend Bowie base 2 at all costs.</p>
	<p><img src="nuke.png"/><br>Your base is equipped with a self-destruct device just next to the commodore's office. <br><img src="disk.png"/><br> It can be activated with an Osterhagen key. Keep the Osterhagen key out of enemy hands at all costs, but note that the key CANNOT leave Tartarus under any circumstances.</p>
	<p>The commodore of your base will have spawned on the briefing podium ahead of you. You should all formulate a plan to defend and fortify Bowie Base 2.</p>
	<p>Tartarus houses a secret airfield, which you can use to defend yourselves against <b>planetary bombardment</b> refer to <b>https://nsv.beestation13.com/wiki/Guide_to_Fighters</b> for information on how to fly them.</p>
	<p>The enemy will come from many angles, and there are many attack vectors. Ensure you secure sufficient points of entry to deny the crew access at all costs.</p>
